# Pebble Authenticator
## by the Crytpo Knights (Lucas David, Holly Lowe, and Michael Slevin)

This is a Pebble Watch App that can be used as a two time authenticator for any website that uses a time based key for two-time authentication. 

### Installation: 

Install the iOS application (PebbleAuthenticator) on your iPhone by opening the Xcode project and running it on your device. Install the Pebble Watch App (PebAuth) by enabling developer mode in the Pebble application settings and running "pebble install --phone [ip]", with the IP address shown under "Pebble Tool Connection" in the developer settings. 

### How to use: 

Open the PebAuth watch app on your Pebble once installed. Open the iOS application and add your accounts by tapping the + icon in the upper right and entering a name and time based key. Once your accounts are added, hit the refresh icon in the top left of the screen to sync all of the accounts on the iOS app with your Pebble. Codes will start showing on the Pebble that can be used for two time authentication. 

### Notes:

This application currently only works in the PST time zone, this can be changed by changing the offset in pebauth.c however.
